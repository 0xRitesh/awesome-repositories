## Guidelines

- Continue to follow the alphabetical ordering that is in place per section.
- Each table column should be padded with one space on either side.
- Add one link per Pull Request.
- Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add repository-name` *for e.g.*: `Add awesome-python`
- Use a short descriptive commit message. *for e.g.*: ❌Update README.md ✔Add Git to the CheatSheets
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Don't mention "Awesome" in the repository name while adding a link in the README, if you are adding an awesome repository . *for e.g.*: ❌Awesome-Python  ✔Python
- If the repository has `No License`, simply add No License to the License column.
